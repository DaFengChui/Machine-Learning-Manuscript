\subsection{The Challenge of Unsupervised Learning}
Unsupervised learning is often much more challenging than supervised learning. Because its exercise tends to be more subjective, and there is no simple goal for the analysis, such as prediction of a response. 

Unsupervised learning is often performed as part of an exploratory data analysis. It can be exploratory hard to assess the results of unsupervised learning methods, since there is no universally accepted mechanism for performing crossvalidation or validating results on an independent data set.
